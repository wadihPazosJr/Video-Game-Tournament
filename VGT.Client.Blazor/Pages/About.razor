<PageHeader _ImageId="aboutUsPageHeader"_Header="Meet our Team" _ImageSrc="/images/AboutPic.PNG">Welcome to the About Page! This team has worked tirelessly to ensure that the event will run as planned to the best of our ability. This whole project was just an idea of mine until they agreed to take this up with me. Let this be a testament to the incredible things we can do within the confinements of our homes when we unite as one. Feel free to read about us and to reach out to our organizations for anything you need!</PageHeader>

     <AboutUsPerson _NameAndTitle="Alec Vizoso / Chief Executive" _ImageSrc="/images/AlecAboutUs.jpg">Hello peoples, my name is Alec Vizoso and I’m currently a junior at Belen Jesuit. For the past month, I’ve been constantly reminded by social media and the news of the front lines during this pandemic, the sacrifices they are making, and the lack of equipment that they are fighting with. I originally had this project as just an idea, something I thought would be a different way to do my part in combating the virus. With this virus, however, this idea has become a reality, a reality that will allow us to contribute to the one cause that all of humanity is currently focused on together. Gaming is something that unites us as we are locked to our houses, and the games the team and I have selected, I hope, are all-encompassing for any type of gamer. I spend my time spreading the gift of music to others when a global pandemic isn’t happening. I also have a strong passion for politics and statistics, and my favorite game series is Fire Emblem (and yes, I’m a Golden Deer). Fear the Deer!</AboutUsPerson>
     <AboutUsPerson _NameAndTitle="Aidan Pevida / Vice Executive" _ImageSrc="/images/AidanAboutUs.PNG">Hello, my name is Wadih Pazos. I am currently a junior at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School. My passions include computer programming, mathematics, and statistics. I actually programmed this website from scratch using React.js! I am also currently programming other projects, such as a political education website. Not only am I interested in learning about my passions, I also love to teach them. I'm excited to help and tutor those who need it!</AboutUsPerson>
     <AboutUsPerson _NameAndTitle="Wadih Pazos / Chief of Operations" _ImageSrc="/images/WadihPazosAboutUs.jpg">Hello, my name is Wadih Pazos. I am currently a junior at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School. My passions include computer programming, mathematics, and statistics. I programmed this website from scratch with Blazor and helped organize the tournaments with the platform Toornament. I enjoyed helping out with this event because it reminds everyone that even through a pandemic, human beings can find a way to serve and help the community, and have fun while doing so!</AboutUsPerson>

     <AboutUsPerson _NameAndTitle="Alex Suarez / Games and Rules" _ImageSrc="/images/WadihPazosAboutUs.jpg">Hi! I’m actually not sure how I ended up here. I just wanted to help my friend, Alec Vizoso, organize an awesome event for an awesome cause. Even though he was excited to have Byleth in Smash, I still consider him a good friend, and when I heard about this, I had to support him in any way I could. My favorite games tend to be single-player, story driven ones, like Hollow Knight or Zelda, but Smash will always have a special place in my heart because Brawl was the first thing I ever beat my older brother in.</AboutUsPerson>
     <AboutUsPerson _NameAndTitle="Nicolas Alarcon / Game and Rules" _ImageSrc="/images/NicoAboutUs.PNG">Hi, my name is Nico. I joined this group to help out where it was needed. Some of my friends here were part of a club I help to run, where we had a charity event planned. Due to COVID-19, it was cancelled. So to me, this game tournament accomplishes good in the absence of the other event. I want to help those in need through a medium I myself enjoy, video games! Personally, my favorite games that we are playing include: Minecraft, Destiny, and Clash Royale.</AboutUsPerson>
     <AboutUsPerson _NameAndTitle="Roland Reyes / Game and Rules" _ImageSrc="/images/RolandAboutUs.png">My name is Roland Reyes, and I’m here to champion those who work in the front lines and who need our help. The fact that they are willing to step up and be on the front lines, caring for those who are heavily sick, is particularly something that touches my heart. On a more personal note, I have certain acquaintances who have COVID-19, so I owe it to them to help them on their journey to recovery. I very much like video games such as Smash and Mario Kart (although Star Wars Battlefront 2 is my favorite) and to me, they represent a way to escape the horrid reality that we are now facing so I can still be a kid. That is why I am here: to give that gift to others and in the process, help the people who are stepping up during this time and doing a saintly action.</AboutUsPerson>
     <AboutUsPerson _NameAndTitle="Julian Castro / Game and Rules" _ImageSrc="/images/CastroAboutUs.png">If I could describe myself in one word it would be “persistent”. Ever since middle school I have been determined to do good onto myself and the people around me. Sometimes my attempts are successful, and sometimes they are not. My attempts that are successful are a result of my unwillingness to give up, which drives those around me insane, whether it be due to the tons of emails and calls I send or the countless amounts of times I need to vent.</AboutUsPerson>
